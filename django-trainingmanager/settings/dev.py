# Django 4.0+ enforces an Origin check on unsafe methods (POST/PUT/...)
# when a same-origin token alone isn't enough — typically when the request
# arrives with a non-matching Origin/Referer header (HSTS-upgraded HTTPS,
# Vite/Angular dev-proxy at :4200 forwarding to /admin/, etc.). On a fresh
# DEBUG runserver this manifests as 'Origin checking failed - X does not
# match any trusted origins' on the admin login POST. Listing the local
# dev origins explicitly fixes /admin/ in every realistic dev setup.
